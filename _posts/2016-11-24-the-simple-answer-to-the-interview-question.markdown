As important as it is to focus on your "hard skills" as a software developer, you need to have a solid foundation of "soft skills" for a succesfull career. This involves occasionally doing job interviews or if you are in the consultancy business, landing a perfect interview is one of the core skills you need to master. 

It is always a good idea to prepare well for the coming interview, doing your research about the company and thinking up answers to some common question. One particular question seems to stress people out, and I remember myself thinking out a cringy answer to it for my first ever job interview: "What is your biggest weakness?"

I have been thinking about this question a lot and finally I figured out an accurate answer for it and have been using it ever since. I discussed this with a colleague a few days ago and told him what I usually tell. And figured, why not share it with the rest of the world?

My thinking is like this, if you know your biggest weakness, why would you not do anything about it? I used to think that I was really bad at databases, so I spent a lot of energy and resources learning everything about them and nowadays I consider it as one of my strengths. So I tell a little backstory about what I've been working on improving the last year and what my current project is. It is simple as that, no need to dig out a creepy personal trait about yourself and somehow turn it into a strength. You show that you have a lot of insight into yourself and are aware of which areas you need to improve on as a developer. Does that not make you an employers dream?
