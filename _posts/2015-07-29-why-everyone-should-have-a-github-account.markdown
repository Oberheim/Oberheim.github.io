#Why everyone should have a GitHub account

I started studying computer science in 2010 and noticed that some of the students were actively using GitHub for their version control needs. I finally created my own account in 2012 and thought that I was horribly late to the party, I had used various SVN based sites for my school projects by then and finally decided that I should switch. However, I already had my workflows for SVN and TFS and never completed the transition, then I started to work full time within the .NET eco system and the company used a locally hosted TFS for version control. So I stayed put with my Visual Studio Online account and never thought more about it.
