I started studying computer science in 2010 and noticed that some of the students were actively using GitHub for their version control needs. I finally created my own account in 2012 and thought that I was horribly late to the party, I had used various SVN based sites for my school projects by then and finally decided that I should switch. However, I already had my workflows for SVN and TFS and never completed the transition, then I started to work full time within the .NET eco system and the company used a locally hosted TFS for version control. So I stayed put with my Visual Studio Online account and never thought more about it.

###Until this summer, when I read the [Passionate Programmer](http://www.amazon.com/The-Passionate-Programmer-Remarkable-Development/dp/1934356344)
You can be the most talented software developer at your company, your unit tests never fail, your code is flawless and you modernize your company's worflows and technology with every project you finish. You are 100% sure that your manager knows how much value you bring to your compnay, right?
The truth is that everything you do is not self evident to even the people in your team, even if you do something amazing, if no one sees it, it didn't happen! So not only do you need to focus on your development skills, from a career perspective it's equally important to market your skills and endeavours. Getting a GitHub account of course does not solve your transparency to your management, but even importantly, it is your first step for gathering data for your current boss and future employers.
