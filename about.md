My name is Alexander Heimonen and I am a software developer and work at the global consulting company Ciber. This blog exists so I can write my thoughts down whenever I have an itch about something tech or programming related. I also regularly perform presentations or talks and in the past I have talked about Continous Delivery and Artificial Intelligence. I am a developer at heart, but in my free time I also enjoy various board games, sports in the form of running, road and mountain bike cycling and of course drinking beer.
